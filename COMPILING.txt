15-122, Spring 2014, Homework 8: C0VM

Compiling:

Use the provided Makefile to compile your code.  It expects your
implementation to be in a file called c0vm.c, for which we've given a
starter incomplete implementation.  Make your changes to c0vm.c and
then compile as below.

To compile using make without debugging turned on:

    make c0vm

To compile using make with debugging turned on:

    make c0vmd

Running:

The included Makefile builds a binary which you can run from the
command line by giving it a bytecode file. Here is the program's usage
information:

    usage (debugging turned off): ./c0vm <bc0_file> [args...]
    usage (debugging turned on):  ./c0vmd <bc0_file> [args...]
